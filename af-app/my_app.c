/**
   Copyright 2019 Afero, Inc.
   This program is a demonstration program that shows you how to capture
   an event from the Afero Cloud to set an edge attribute, and do something with 
   the data that is sent to you. It also inludes the ability to send data
   items from the edge device up to the Cloud. This basic functionality is
   really the basis of all communications with the Afero Cloud and the device.
   Receiving an attribute is typicaly used for some kind of control of
   the device, while sending an attribute to the Cloud is typically used
   for reporting some kind of operational status from the device back to the
   Cloud and mobile app.

   You may wish to watch the git repository from which you pulled this sample
   code as it will become more fleshed out over time with added features and
   examples of operation for things like.. device status notifications such 
   as changes in the RSSI of wifi or blue tooth, and events as well as schedules.

// I generally like to group some defines here for debugging purposes. Whenever I run into
// some kind of odd issue that I want to examine closely, either through logs or by creating a place
// to move a variable so that I can set a breakpoint in order to examine it, I will create an appropriate
// DEBUG_something define that let's me turn it on and off at compile time.
// You can also use an attribute to control such messaging by simply testing the contents of that
// attribute every time you decide to print a log entry. One way of doing this is to use
// an attribute of 32 bits in size and then assign bit significances in that 
// attribute for various parts of the program.
// Below are a couple examples that were used but have been since removed. Leaving them here
// as a tip/technique for debugging.
